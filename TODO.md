# To Do

## Completed Tasks  
* create framework for common code (HomeLock, requests, etc.)
* create lock animation
* display error for lock (for example, if server can't be reached). show error by turning red?
* improve settings page: have gear icon is a corner and pop-up/segue to new view to enter ip/port/url
