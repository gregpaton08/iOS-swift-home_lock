# To Do  

## Tasks  
* create gear icon for settings button
* use reachability framework (cocoapods?) so that it can be accessed from widget and from the app

## Completed Tasks  
* create framework for common code (HomeLock, requests, etc.)
* create lock animation
* display error for lock (for example, if server can't be reached). show error by turning red?
* improve settings page: have gear icon is a corner and pop-up/segue to new view to enter ip/port/url
* improve lock disabled mode: for example, show an 'x' in the middle of the lock?
* make spinner view line width a function of view height so it doesn't look as thick in the widget view

## Stretch Goals  
* [HomeKit integration](https://developer.apple.com/homekit/specification/)
